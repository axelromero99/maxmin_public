</h1>

This is my first big project. It took me like 1 year and 6 months to develop it, in conjunct to Germ√°n Bignotti. I started developing it with a good base of data science and python, but nothing fancy, so in the process of the creation i learn a lot (debugging, logs, multiprocessing, threading, numpy, data structures, search and sorting, a bunch of Pandas, plots, and about python GUI's). 

The project consisted a software oriented to historical analysis of financial currencys and crypto currencys, aplying Data Science with Python. The work was carried out in conjunction with a financial advisor (Germ√°n C√°ceres Bignotti), who wanted to migrate an algorithm created in plain text and Google Sheets spreadsheets to a program that automates the tasks of an specific historical analysis. We use various web tools like Trello and Slack for organizing our work-flow in a SCRUM methodology ( because of that, i learn a lot of agile methodologies and now i try to implement them in my personal workflow and projects with others). The project ended in a relatively good result, with a minimum viable product, but I had to abandon it for personal reasons.

Aclaration: I cannot upload the code because the algorithm behind was totally created by German C√°ceres, and it is a valuable work that took him years. I hope to continue this project some day.
